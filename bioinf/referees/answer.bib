	Abstract = {Gastric cancer is a leading cause of cancer
                  deaths, but analysis of its molecular and clinical
                  characteristics has been complicated by histological
                  and aetiological heterogeneity. Here we describe a
                  comprehensive molecular evaluation of 295 primary
                  gastric adenocarcinomas as part of The Cancer Genome
                  Atlas (TCGA) project. We propose a molecular
                  classification dividing gastric cancer into four
                  subtypes: tumours positive for Epstein-Barr virus,
                  which display recurrent PIK3CA mutations, extreme
                  DNA hypermethylation, and amplification of JAK2,
                  CD274 (also known as PD-L1) and PDCD1LG2 (also known
                  as PD-L2); microsatellite unstable tumours, which
                  show elevated mutation rates, including mutations of
                  genes encoding targetable oncogenic signalling
                  proteins; genomically stable tumours, which are
                  enriched for the diffuse histological variant and
                  mutations of RHOA or fusions involving RHO-family
                  GTPase-activating proteins; and tumours with
                  chromosomal instability, which show marked
                  aneuploidy and focal amplification of receptor
                  tyrosine kinases. Identification of these subtypes
                  provides a roadmap for patient stratification and
                  trials of targeted therapies.},

	abstract = {Gastric cancer is not a single disease, and its
                  subtype classification is still
                  evolving. Next-generation sequencing studies have
                  identified novel genetic drivers of gastric cancer,
                  but their use as molecular classifiers or prognostic
                  markers of disease outcome has yet to be
                  established. In this study, we integrated somatic
                  mutational profiles and clinicopathologic
                  information from 544 gastric cancer patients from
                  previous genomic studies to identify significantly
                  mutated genes (SMG) with prognostic
                  relevance. Gastric cancer patients were classified
                  into regular (86.8\%) and hypermutated (13.2\%)
                  subtypes based on mutation burden. Notably, TpCpW
                  mutations occurred significantly more frequently in
                  regular, but not hypermutated, gastric cancers,
                  where they were associated with APOBEC
                  expression. In the former group, six previously
                  unreported (XIRP2, NBEA, COL14A1, CNBD1, ITGAV, and
                  AKAP6) and 12 recurrent mutated genes exhibited high
                  mutation prevalence (>=3.0\%) and an unexpectedly
                  higher incidence of nonsynonymous mutations. We also
                  identified two molecular subtypes of regular-mutated
                  gastric cancer that were associated with distinct
                  prognostic outcomes, independently of disease
                  staging, as confirmed in a distinct patient cohort
                  by targeted capture sequencing. Finally, in
                  diffuse-type gastric cancer, CDH1 mutation was found
                  to be associated with shortened patient survival,
                  independently of disease staging. Overall, our work
                  identified previously unreported SMGs and a mutation
                  signature predictive of patient survival in newly
                  classified subtypes of gastric cancer, offering
                  opportunities to stratify patients into optimal
                  treatment plans based on molecular subtyping. Cancer

abstract = "The R statistical environment and language has demonstrated particular strengths for interactive development of statistical algorithms, as well as data modelling and visualisation. Its current implementation has an interpreter at its core which may result in a performance penalty in comparison to directly executing user algorithms in the native machine code of the host CPU. In contrast, the C++ language has no built-in visualisation capabilities, handling of linear algebra or even basic statistical algorithms; however, user programs are converted to high-performance machine code, ahead of execution. A new method avoids possible speed penalties in R by using the Rcpp extension package in conjunction with the Armadillo C++ matrix library. In addition to the inherent performance advantages of compiled code, Armadillo provides an easy-to-use template-based meta-programming framework, allowing the automatic pooling of several linear algebra operations into one, which in turn can lead to further speedups. With the aid of Rcpp and Armadillo, conversion of linear algebra centred algorithms from R to C++ becomes straightforward. The algorithms retain the overall structure as well as readability, all while maintaining a bidirectional link with the host R environment. Empirical timing comparisons of R and C++ implementations of a Kalman filtering algorithm indicate a speedup of several orders of magnitude. "
