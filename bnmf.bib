    abstract = {Nonnegative matrix approximation ({NNMA}) is a recent
    technique for dimensionality reduction and data analysis that yields
    a parts based, sparse nonnegative representation for nonnegative input
    data. {NNMA} has found a wide variety of applications, including text
    analysis, document clustering, face/image recognition, language modeling,
    speech processing and many others. Despite these numerous applications,
    the algorithmic development for computing the {NNMA} factors has been
    relatively deficient. This paper makes algorithmic progress by
    modeling and solving (using multiplicative updates) new generalized
    {NNMA} problems that minimize Bregman divergences between the input
    matrix and its lowrank approximation. The multiplicative update formulae
    in the pioneering work by Lee and Seung [11] arise as a special
    case of our algorithms. In addition, the paper shows how to use
    penalty functions for incorporating constraints other than nonnegativity
    into the problem. Further, some interesting extensions to the use
    of link functions for modeling nonlinear relationships are also
    discussed. 1},

 OPTabstract = {In the context of Bayes estimation via Gibbs sampling,
       with or without data augmentation, a simple approach is developed
       for computing the marginal density of the sample data (marginal
       likelihood) given parameter draws from the posterior
       distribution. Consequently, Bayes factors for model comparisons
       can be routinely computed as a by-product of the simulation.
       Hitherto, this calculation has proved extremely challenging.
       Our approach exploits the fact that the marginal density can be
       expressed as the prior times the likelihood function over the
       posterior density. This simple identity holds for any parameter value.
       An estimate of the posterior density is shown to be available if
       all complete conditional densities used in the Gibbs sampler have
       closed-form expressions. To improve accuracy, the posterior density
       is estimated at a high density point, and the numerical standard error
       of resulting estimate is derived. The ideas are applied to
       probit regression and finite mixture models.},

    OPTabstract = {{All cancers are caused by somatic mutations;
   however, understanding of the biological processes
   generating these mutations is limited. The catalogue
   of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the
   signatures of the mutational processes that have
   been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations
   from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20
   distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in
   many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to
   the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas
   others are confined to a single cancer
   class. Certain signatures are associated with age of
   the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic
   exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many
   are of cryptic origin. In addition to these
   genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation
   localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is
   found in many cancer types. The results reveal the
   diversity of mutational processes underlying the
   development of cancer, with potential implications
   for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention
   and therapy.}},

  abstract={The collective somatic mutations observed in a cancer are
           the outcome of multiple mutagenic processes that
           have been operative over the lifetime of a
           patient. Each process leaves a characteristic
           imprint [mdash] a mutational signature [mdash] on
           the cancer genome, which is defined by the type of
           DNA damage and DNA repair processes that result in
           base substitutions, insertions and deletions or
           structural variations. With the advent of
           whole-genome sequencing, researchers are identifying
           an increasing array of these signatures. Mutational
           signatures can be used as a physiological readout of
           the biological history of a cancer and also have
           potential use for discerning ongoing mutational
           processes from historical ones, thus possibly

@Article{RMHTS,
  Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analysis of somatic mutations
  provides insight into the mutational processes that have
  shaped the cancer genome, but such analysis currently
  requires large cohorts. We develop deconstructSigs, which
  allows the identification of mutational signatures within a
  single tumor sample. RESULTS: Application of deconstructSigs
  identifies samples with DNA repair deficiencies and reveals
  distinct and dynamic mutational processes molding the cancer
  genome in esophageal adenocarcinoma compared to squamous cell
  carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: deconstructSigs confers the ability
  to define mutational processes driven by environmental exposures,
  DNA repair abnormalities, and mutagenic processes in individual
  tumors with implications for precision cancer medicine.
